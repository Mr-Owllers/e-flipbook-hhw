                        <p class="pad">
                            The Indian Forest Act, 1927 was enacted during pre-independence era with the objective
                            “to consolidate the law relating to forests, the transit of forest-produce and the duty
                            leviable on timber and other forest-produce.” It also sought to consolidate and reserve the
                            areas having forest cover, or significant wildlife.
                            The Forests Act establishes three kinds of forests, namely, Reserve Forests, Protected
                            Forests and Village Forests. Reserved forests are the most restrictive category of forests.
                            These forests are constituted by the State Government on any forestland or wasteland
                            which is the property of the government or on which the government has proprietary
                            rights.

                                Protected forests, constituted by the state government, are forests other than
                                reserved forests over which the government has proprietary rights. Village forests, are
                                those in which the state government assigns to 'any village-community the rights of
                                government to or over any land which has been constituted a reserved forest'.”
                                The Act also defines a forest offence and vests power in the State Governments to
                                impose penalties on violation of the provisions of the Act.

                                The Wildlife Protection Act is the most important statute providing
                                protection of wildlife. “The Act prohibits hunting of animals listed in
                                Schedule I, II, III & IV. Under the Act, the state government may
                                declare any area of adequate ecological, fauna, floral, natural or
                                zoological importance as a sanctuary or a national park. In both
                                national parks & sanctuaries, public entry is restricted & the
                                destruction of any wildlife or habitat is prohibited. In 1986 the Act was
                                suitably amended. Under the 1972 Act, trade & commerce in wild
                                animals, animal articles and trophies was permissible within the
                                country. But many traders smuggled the animal skins, animal articles
                                and trophies to foreign countries for getting huge profit.

                                1986 Amendment Act it was provided that no one will be allowed to
                                carry on trade in wild animals specified in Schedules I & II of the Act.
                                Also the then existing licenses for internal trade of animals and animal
                                articles were revoked and a total ban on trade in Indian ivory was
                                imposed.”

                                In 1980, the Parliament, in response to the rapid decline in the forest covers in India, and also
                                to fulfill the Constitutional obligation under Article 48-A (42nd Amendment in 1976), enacted a
                                new legislation called the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.<br><br>
                                The Act made the prior approval of the Central Government necessary for de-reservation of
                                reserved forest and for use of forest land for non-forest purposes. It also provided for the
                                constitution of an advisory committee to advise the Central Government with regard to grant of
                                such approval.

                                In national interest and in the interest of future generations, this Act regulates the diversion of forest
                                lands to non forestry purposes. The basic objective of the Act is to regulate the indiscriminate diversion
                                of forest lands for non forestry uses and to maintain a balance between the developmental needs of the
                                country and the conservation of natural heritage
